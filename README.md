# Macabre

**macabre** : (adj) _tending to produce horror in a beholder_

Seriously, Just back away slowly. I'm just playing around.

Are you still here? Don't you know there's a monster at the end of this book?

## OMG, What have you done?

Nothing, yet. It only "barely" works if we carefully redefine "barely" to "doesn't".

This is an ultra experimental compiler written in Gleam to compile Gleam source code (using
the [glance](https://hexdocs.pm/glance/) package) to Python.

## Why are you doing this?

I have no idea. It's fun and educational. (I'm on a roll with this redefining words thing.)

## Usage

```sh
gleam run -- some_very_simple_file.gleam  # compile to python
```

## Development

Run tests with gleeunit:

```sh
gleam test
```

Run tests in watch mode:

```sh
fd .gleam | entr gleam test
```

## Contributing

Are you insane?

Sweet, me too.

PRs are welcome.

The main entry point is `macabre.gleam`, which handles all file loading and
other side effects. The compiler is pure gleam. Most of the work happens in
`transformer.gleam` and `generator.gleam`. The former converts the Gleam AST to
a Python AST, the latter generates python code. There are tons of helper
functions in various other files.

The Python AST is in `python.gleam`. This doesn't model all of python; just the
subset that is needed to map Gleam expressions to.

Some tasks below are marked easy if you want to get started.

### Outstanding Todos

This is a list of all outstanding `todo` expressions (Gleam todo expressions
are Ôüê) in the codebase, as of the last time that I updated this list.

- imports with attributes are not handled yet
- type imports are not implemented yet
- Unlabelled fields in custom types are not generated yet
  - Given that labelled and unlabelled fields can be mixed on one class, I have
    a feeling we have to ditch dataclasses. Probably a custom class with slots, a
    dict of names to indices, and a custom **match_args** that can handle
    tuple-like _or_ record-like syntax?
- Labelled parameters in function calls are not transformed (ie `fn foo(bar baz: Str)`)
- (EASY) Discard parameters in function arguments are not transformed
- Codepoints in bistrings are not supported yet
- non-byte-aligned bitstrings are not supported yet
- case guards are not supported yet
- Functions as type fields are not supported yet
  - debatable whether to make them a `def` right on the class or have the def be defined somewhere and just attach it like other fields
- Fields that are "HoleType" are not supported and I don't even know what that means
- IN case statements, the following patterns are not supported:
  - Concatenate patterns
  - Bitstring patterns (bytes)
  - The problem with both is python match has no way to match on "parts" of bytes or strings. Possible solutions:
    - convert the entity to a python list and match on that
    - construct a potentially massive match guard ('case ... if') to compare elements.
- Destructuring in assignments is not supported yet
  - (EASY) tuple destructuring can map straight to python destructuring
  - other structures will maybe need a match statement?
- Use statements are not supported yet

### Some other things I know are missing

- empty tuples are probably broken
  - (EASY) I used parens instead of a `,` like a total python NOOB
- no let assert
- (EASY) const definitions aren't supported yet (module.constants)
- type aliases aren't supported yet (module.type_aliases)
- Not doing anything to avoid collision between gleam identifiers with python keywords
  - Especially: shadowed variable names behave differently if used in closures
- glance itself doesn't support comments, so these are stripped out of the compiled code
- glance doesn't have (much of) a typechecker
- not currently generating python type hints (e.g. function arguments and
  return types), but gleam gives us that info so may as well use it
- no concept of a "project", gleam.toml, downloading dependencies
- only compiles one module at a time, doesn't follow imports
- copies the prelude module blindly into the directory that contains that one module instead of a top level
- No standard library
  - No Result custom type yet (I thought this needed to be in the prelude, but I don't see any result-specific syntax anywhere)
- generate `__main__.py` if a module has a main function
- calling functions or constructors with out-of-order positional args doesn't
  work in python
  - e.g. `Foo(mystr: String, point: #(Int, Int))` can be called with `Foo(#(1,
1), mystr: "Foo")` in gleam
  - javascript seems to solve this by automatically reordering the arguments to
    match the input type
- (EASY) I notice that the javascript doesn't generate the wrapping class for custom
  variants. I think we should make top level types for each constructor and then a type union
  for all the types in a single class.
- Related: if you have a multi-variant type where the first constructor shadows
  the type's name, it breaks
- (EASY) maybe call ruff or black on the files after they are output, if they are installed.
- Code is very not commented
